# VSCode

We provided VSCode for JSBox from very early version: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Ying.jsbox

It improves your experience to writing code for JSBox, and also provides real-time syncing for JSBox.

Starting from v0.0.6, JSBox can upload package to your device, as long as the folder looks like:

- **assets/**
- **scripts/**
- **strings/**
- **config.json**
- **main.js**

It archives the folder, upload to your iOS device, and run it automatically.
