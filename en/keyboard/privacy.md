# Privacy Policy

JSBox won't track user inputs, will never upload to our server, or even save it locally.

To make sure scripts work correctly, you may need to "**Allow Full Access**":

When "Allow Full Access" is off, there are many restrictions:

- Unable to access network
- Unable to access location
- Unable to access clipboard
- Unable to access iCloud
- Unable to get settings from app

Please consider allow full access on your behalf, but we have to say, even allow full access is on, we won't use any technical measures to manipulate user inputs.

Please be confident with our products.
