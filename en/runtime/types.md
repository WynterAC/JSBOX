> Convert values between runtime and native environment

# Methods

Note:

- All values generated by runtime APIs are Objective-C values.
- All values generated by JSBox APIs are JavaScript values.

Therefore, there are 2 methods provided to convert them:

- `jsValue()` Objective-C value to JavaScript value
- `ocValue()` JavaScript value to Objective-C value

# Example

This is a JavaScript value:

```js
const color1 = $color("red");
```

If we want to use this in runtime APIs, we need to concert it first: `color1.ocValue()`.

And this is a Objective-C value:

```js
const color2 = $objc("UIColor").invoke("grayColor");
```

If we want to use this in JSBox APIs, we also need to convert it:

```js
props: {
  bgcolor: color2.jsValue()
}
```

Through these two methods, we can handle all values between Runtime APIs and JSBox APIs.
