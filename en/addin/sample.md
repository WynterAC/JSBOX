> In order to understand $addin APIs are very important, we created two examples

- Import scripts from inbox: [sync-inbox](https://github.com/cyanzhong/xTeko/blob/master/extension-demos/sync-inbox.js)
- Install scripts online: [addin-gallery](https://github.com/cyanzhong/xTeko/blob/master/extension-demos/addin-gallery.js)

For the purpose of safety, we don't provide any solution to install a script by user.

You should understand the meaning of script before you run it.
