# Extended APIs

JSBox provided various of APIs other than iOS builtin APIs, we will talk about those.

Basically we provided `$text`, `$share`, `$qrcode` and `$detector` for now.

# $text

Handle text easily, such as base64 encode/decode and much more.

# $share

Share media (text/image etc) to social network services.

# $qrcode

QRCode related features, such as encode/decode and scan.

# $browser

Simulate a browser environment, so you can leverage the ability of BOM and DOM.

# $detector

Some functions to handle common data detection easily, similar to regular expressions.
